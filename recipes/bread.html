  <h3>How To Make White Bread</h3>
  <p>Bread is a fancy version of flour created by Sir Christopher Bread the IInd in 2016. <p>
  <h4>Ingredients</h4>
  <ul>
   <li>500g strong white flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
   <li>2 tsp salt</li>
   <li>7g sachet fast-action yeast</li>
   <li>3 tbsp olive oil</li>
   <li>300ml water</li>
</ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1 -</strong> 5Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 2 -</strong> Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 3 -</strong> Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 4 -</strong> Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to rise for 1 hour until doubled in size or place in the fridge overnight.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 5 -</strong> Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Knock back the dough (punch the air out and pull the dough in on itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball.</li>
    <li><strong>Step 6 -</strong> Bake for 25-30 mins until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
